# Analysis of Algorithms 1
This repository contains all the assigned homework for the BLG 335E Analysis of Algorithms-I course during the 2023-2024 fall semester at Istanbul Technical University. The code is written in C++, according to the provided instructions. No built-in data structures are utilized except for `<vector>`. All other data structures and algorithms are implemented from scratch.

The repository is composed of the following:

* Quicksort
  * Naive quicksort
  * Quicksort with different pivoting strategies
  * Hybrid quicksort with insertion sort

* Heap
  * Heapsort

* Tree
  * Binary Search Tree (BST)
  * Red-Black Tree     (RBT)

In each project, related datasets and instructional documents are housed within their respective folders. It should be noted that fundamental operations, including insertion, deletion, searching, sorting, and others, are encompassed in coded data structures. Additionally, the measurement of execution times and the derivation of inferences are facilitated through the use of the `<chrono>` library. For a comprehensive understanding of implementation details, discussions, and instructions on program execution, reference to the associated report file is recommended.
